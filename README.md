## 🚀 About Me
- **Who I Am**: A curious, self-taught coder and investigator passionate about uncovering insights and building intelligent systems.
- **Pronouns**: He/Him  
- **Location**: 🇦🇹 Austria
- **Current Obsession**: Making AI models roast each other and accidentally starting Twitter beef with AWS
- **Fun Fact**: My over-enthusiastic liking spree once got me flagged as a "spammer" – now I focus on meaningful interactions and proper cybersecurity reporting!

---

## 🔍 What I'm Working On
- **Local AI**: Exploring the potential of running AI models locally for privacy, efficiency, and maximum chaos potential
- **OSINT**: Mastering the art of gathering and analyzing publicly available data to uncover hidden patterns (and occasionally stumbling into international phishing operations)
- **Cybersecurity Research**: Hunting down scammers, reporting credential leaks, and learning why big tech companies have interesting priorities
- **Programming**:
  - 🐍 **Python**: Building scripts for automation, data analysis, and AI experimentation
  - 🖥️ **Bash/PowerShell**: Crafting efficient workflows and system utilities
  - 🤖 **AI Collaboration**: Working with multiple AI models for enhanced problem-solving (and entertainment)

**Current Goals**:
- Deepening expertise in AI model optimization and multi-model workflows
- Contributing to open-source AI and OSINT projects  
- Learning when to escalate cybersecurity issues to ICANN vs Twitter
- Collaborating on impactful tools (that hopefully don't break the internet)
